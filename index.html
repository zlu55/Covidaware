							</a>
						</div>
						<div class = "subtopicBody">
							<p>	Since the beginning of COVID-19 information and statistics has been scattered across the internet. Resulting in a need for a website that 
								simply displays information about COVID-19 in a user friendly manner.<br><br>
								This document outlines the proposed COVIDaware website. This document will outline the goals of our project, as well as outline the requirements 
								we are trying to fulfil. This document outlines all features of our project, plans for interfaces, and design. This document is intended to be 
								helpful to both users and developers.

							</a>
						</div>
						<div class = "subtopicBody">
							<p>	The software product will be a user friendly website called COVIDaware. COVIDaware will be an intuitive method for accessing all information 
								regarding COVID-19, in a user-friendly format. This website will not just display statistics, but will also be complemented with corresponding 
								visual aids. The objective of COVIDaware is to create an all inclusive tool to help users develop a deeper understanding of COVID-19 data.

							<p>	There is no cost constraint for COVIDaware as it uses free software to implement the Web App. The project does have development constraints of 
								time and reliability. The time constraint is that the project must be finished by the end of the Semester, April 12th. The reliability constraint 
								is that the CovidWare Website doesn't refresh every time data has been updated in the Canada Covid database.
